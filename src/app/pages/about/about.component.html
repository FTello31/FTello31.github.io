  <p class="text-[#64ffda] mb-2">Hi, I'm a developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect user
    interfaces that blend thoughtful design with robust engineering. My favorite projects live at the intersection
    of design and development, creating experiences that not only look great but are meticulously built for
    performance and usability.</p>

  <p class="mt-4">Currently, I'm a Senior Front-End Engineer at <span class="text-[#64ffda]">Company</span>,
    specializing in accessibility. I contribute best practices to infrastructure of UI components that power
    Nextgen frontends, ensuring our platform meets web accessibility standards and best practices to create an
    exceptional user experience.</p>

  <p class="mt-4">In the past, I've had the opportunity to develop software across a variety of domains at <span
      class="text-[#64ffda]">operating systems</span> and <span class="text-[#64ffda]">large organizations</span>.
    I also <span class="text-[#64ffda]">built</span> and <span class="text-[#64ffda]">designed</span> a <span
      class="text-[#64ffda]">video course</span> a few years ago, guiding learners through building a web app with
    the Spotify API.</p>

  <p class="mt-4">In my spare time, I'm usually climbing, reading, hanging out with my wife and two cats, or
    training around trying swimming for <span class="text-[#64ffda]">Kona spots</span>.</p>
