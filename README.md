## üßë‚Äçüíª About Me

Software developer with 6 years of experience in Angular and Java, and over 3 years specializing in frontend development with Angular.

Currently pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and actively seeking AI-focused roles. I'm passionate about leveraging AI to enhance the software development process‚Äîmaking it faster, more efficient, and less error-prone.

My background in full-stack development gives me a strong foundation to understand practical implementation challenges and build smart, scalable solutions. While my core expertise is in software engineering, I also hold AWS certifications and maintain an active interest in cloud technologies as part of my broader technical toolkit.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To start a local development server:

````bash
ng serve




# FernandoTello

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.8.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
````

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
